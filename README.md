It's a README file.

Thank you for reading it.

This code was mostly written by me but was also source from the following:
credit card exercise from wk2 segment 6
multisheet code was lifted from extendoffice.com

The VBA code is located in VBA-challenge/stonkifier.bas in my repo. Sorry if the extension is 
wrong. It does work when you drag it in.

As requested, this includes a screenshot of the results along with the VBA script written
to produce them. 

Separate files: the main file, "stonkifier" contains 3 modules which I have separated out for you:
1.multisheet - adds functionality across multiple excel worksheets
2.formatsheets - format the sheets and makes them look decent
3.stonkanalysis - the main part of the code that breaks down the figures as requested.
